The purposes of the site are:

- Share the experience of the community network project in Cepeda.
- File and keep the technical documentation available.
- Give thanks for the help received and try to help those who need it to replicate this community network project in other places.

If you wish to collaborate in the Cepeda project, on this site to contribute content as an editor, translator or simply to express your opinion, I invite you to contact through the [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#hotspotcepeda:matrix.org) channel created for this and contribute on [github](https://github.com/hotspotcepeda).

I think that telecommunications in our current society have to be available to all people and that is why I consider them a fundamental right, as are education or public health. I want to thank all those people who share their experience, knowledge and information to put them at the service of the development of humanity in a selfless way.

{{< notice warning >}}
I also want to add that I am not a professional programmer and I do not do this for profit, I only do this because I like telecommunications and technology. If I'm wrong in any way, please accept my sincere apologies.
