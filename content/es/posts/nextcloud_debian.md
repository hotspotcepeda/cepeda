ADD NEXTCLOUD REPOSITORY
Add the Nextcloud repository in the /etc/apt/sources.d/nextcloud.list
``` bash
echo 'deb http://apt.jurisic.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nextcloud.list
```
Install release key of Nextcloud repository:
``` bash
wget -q http://apt.jurisic.org/Release.key -O- | apt-key add -
```
And run apt-get update to download the list of packages.
``` bash
apt-get update
```
INSTALL NEXTCLOUD CLIENT
Install Nextcloud server with:
``` bash
apt-get install nextcloud-client
```
INSTALL NEXTCLOUD SERVER
INSTALL POSTGRESQL AND SETUP NEW USER & DATABASE
Install PostgreSQL with:
``` bash
apt-get install postgresql
```
- The PostgreSQL package will install all required dependencies.
- Choose Â«yÂ» to start the installation.
- Add a PostgreSQL database
- The next step is to create a PostgreSQL database for nextcloud.
- Login to PostgreSQL on the commandline by running this command:
``` bash
su - postgres
psql
```
Enter the following commands to create a database user with the name Â«nextuserÂ» and and a database name Â«nextcloudÂ». Replace the word Â«StorngPasswordHereÂ» with your own password in the commands.
``` bash
CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;
CREATE USER nextuser WITH PASSWORD 'StorngPasswordHere';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nextcloud to nextuser;
```
Install Nextcloud server with:
``` bash
apt-get install nextcloud-server
```
When the shell part of the installation is finished, proceed by opening the Nextcloud web installer in your browser. The URL is http://[YOURIP]/nextcloud. In my case the IP is 192.168.1.100 so I enter http://192.168.1.100/nextcloud in my browser to get the installer:

Enter the desired administrator username and password in the login fields. Please choose a secure password and also a username that is not Â«adminÂ» or Â«administratorÂ» might be a good choice to make it less easy for attackers to guess your admin login.

Nextcloud is using sqlite as storage engine by default. This is not a good choice performace wise, so I will choose PostgreSQL as database backend. We have created a PostgreSQL database above, enter the details of that database now:

Username:       nextuser
Password:       The password that you have choosen for the database.
Database name:  nextcloud
Hostname:       localhost

ACCESS NEXTCLOUD WITH SSL (HTTPS)
The default installation of Nextcloud is not secured by SSL. To enable SSL in your webserver, run these commands:
``` bash
a2enmod ssl
a2ensite default-ssl
service apache2 restart
```
Now you can access the web interface with https://[YOURIP]/nextcloud. You will probably get a SSL warning, this warning should be accepted. To avoid such warnings, get a free officially signed SSL certificate e.g. from Startssl (or check LetsEncrypt).

LETSENCRYPT
STEP 1 â€” DOWNLOAD THE LETâ€™S ENCRYPT CLIENT
The first step to using Letâ€™s Encrypt to obtain an SSL certificate is to install the certbot software on your server. The Certbot developers maintain their own Ubuntu software repository with up-to-date versions of the software. Because Certbot is in such active development itâ€™s worth using this repository to install a newer Certbot than provided by Ubuntu.

First, add the repository:
``` bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
```
Youâ€™ll need to press ENTER to accept. Afterwards, update the package list to pick up the new repositoryâ€™s package information:
``` bash
sudo apt-get update
```
And finally, install Certbot from the new repository with apt-get:
``` bash
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-apache
```
The certbot Letâ€™s Encrypt client is now ready to use.

STEP 2 â€” SET UP THE SSL CERTIFICATE
``` bash
letsencrypt --apache
```
